      <p>We do not use cookies for any reason. We do not allow any third parties to run JavaScript on our domain. We do
        not track you, nor allow anyone else to. Nothing is stored on our servers, which are just static site servers.
        Everything happens in your browser.</p>
      <p>Indyfam does use Facebook's Instagram Basic Access API to display the photos of the user you enter at the beginning. If this user has their photos set to private you will have to login and Facebook will be able to see this activity.</p>
      <p>We run server-side analytics purely to satisfy our own curiosity about how many people are using the site. No
          personally identifiable information is gathered by our analytics.</p>
